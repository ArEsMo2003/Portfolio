										<h1>Motivation</h1>
									</header>
									<p>My journey didn’t begin with privilege; it began with determination. I had no financial backing, no stable or free access to the internet, and no chance to enroll in expensive courses. Everything I have learned came from free resources, online courses, documentation, and nights spent patiently downloading content through unstable connections. I started programming out of a pure love for creating—starting with Java and Python, moving on to Artificial Intelligence , data analysis, and even building Three games using Godot and Unreal. Each project was more than just a technical output; it was proof that progress is possible even in the face of restrictions.</p>
									<p>Alongside my technical learning, I gained real work experience: from serving as the executive assistant on a Company, managing communication between departments and stakeholders, to producing written content and privately teaching English and Turkish. These roles taught me how to communicate effectively, make the right decisions under pressure, and find balance between quality and deadlines.</p>
									<p>I believe in teamwork, but I’m equally comfortable taking individual responsibility. Version control, Git, UI/UX design, implementation, testing, deployment—these are all parts of a chain I’ve experienced firsthand. I’ve learned that if something isn’t accessible, I need to create it or find a way around the limitation.</p>
									<p>My goal is simple: to build products that bring real value to users, solve real-world problems, and grow in a path where technology and creativity merge—whether in software engineering, game development, or combining both with data and AI.</p>
									<p>I proudly say that my current achievements are not the result of luxury or resources but of persistence, self-discipline, self-learning, and resilience. If you are reading this portfolio, I want you to see one thing: someone who built hallways when the doors were closed.</p>
									<p>I am ready for the next stage—where I can learn faster, build deeper, and create greater value in a research-driven and collaborative environment. If this vision resonates with you, I’d be glad to collaborate—whether on a research idea, a serious product, or a game designed to bring joy.</p>
									<p>This is just the beginning.</p>
